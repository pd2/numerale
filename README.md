I am launching a "Wordle" style puzzle but with numbers. 

The player has to guess a hidden five digit number within six chances . Each guess reveals some clues about the correct numerals and their position (via arrows). The twist here is that these numerals are displayed in one of the 11 Indian scripts of your choice.

I decoded Indic #Numerale 13268 in Telugu script 3/6
